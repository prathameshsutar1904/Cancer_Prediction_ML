🧬 Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach to predict the severity of cancer cases using patient diagnostic and lifestyle data. It leverages Python and libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to preprocess, explore, and model data using various classification algorithms.

📌 Description

This project is based on a comprehensive dataset of **50,000 cancer patients collected between 2015 and 2024** from various countries. The dataset includes a wide range of features such as age, gender, region, genetic risk, lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol use), and environmental factors (e.g., air pollution). Additionally, it contains medical details like cancer type, stage, treatment cost, and survival years.  

This project demonstrates how machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree Classifier can help forecast cancer outcomes and support medical decision-making.
