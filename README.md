# 📁 Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based approach to predict Global Cancer Patients from year 2015 to 2024 Dataset. Multiple classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree Classifier are trained and evaluated to compare their performance.

 📌 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix  
- Model comparison for better insights  

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
